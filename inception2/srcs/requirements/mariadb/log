/usr/bin/mysql_install_db: Deprecated program name. It will be removed in a future release, use 'mariadb-install-db' instead
Installing MariaDB/MySQL system tables in '/var/lib/mysql' ...
OK

To start mariadbd at boot time you have to copy
support-files/mariadb.service to the right place for your system


Two all-privilege accounts were created.
One is root@localhost, it has no password, but you need to
be system 'root' user to connect. Use, for example, sudo mysql
The second is mysql@localhost, it has no password either, but
you need to be the system 'mysql' user to connect.
After connecting you can set the password, if you would need to be
able to connect as any of these users with a password and without sudo
